You can use this time to sort through your Gossamer collection and pull out the Gossamers you will be using to create your look, take out all of your tools and make sure they are readily available, etc.\n\n“How do I know when the bond is tacky?” Don’t worry about counting to 30 in order to know when your bond is tacky. Instead, flutter your lashes, when your natural lashes start feeling sticky that’s a good sign that the bond has dried! Now you’re ready for Gossamer application.\n\nTIP: If you don’t feel like playing the waiting game, or are in too much of a rush to let the bond get tacky on it’s own, you can fast-track the process with the help of our Blow tool, sold separately on the Lashify website. This $7 gadget is one of the tools you wondered how you ever lived without. Especially in your Lashify Life.",
