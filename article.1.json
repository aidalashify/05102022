        "description": "Welcome to 2021, the year that you apply a full face of makeup and then instantly cover it up with a mask. Today’s beauty gurus are saying that this year it is all about the eyes and what better way to define, highlight and enhance them than with luscious lashes and perfect brows! Getting killer brows is as easy as 1, 2, 3 and getting those perfect, long lashes is even easier with Lashify. Don’t know where to start to amp up your brow game? \n<br><br>\nBefore we break it down, let’s talk about the brow glow up that has come upon us over the last few years. In the 80’s bushy brows were a hit, in the 90’s brows were overplucked and skinny to resemble the shape of the McDonald’s arch, in the early 2000’s the darker and fuller brows were, the better. And now in 2021 we have finally accepted the natural brow but with a beautiful, full shape. If you’re like me, I over-plucked my brows in the 90s and spent all of the early 2000’s growing them back. From there I have tried bleaching them, tinting them, laminating them, and have contemplated micro-blading them until I found the perfect DIY Brow Cocktail that worked for me! We're going to break down the perfect eyebrow shaping guide in 4 easy steps!",

I personally like to shape my brows and then go in to pluck any strays that don’t compliment the brow that I just created. You also have to remember too that whatever you pluck is gone and isn’t growing back anytime soon. As we age our eyebrow hairs change and grow back slower and sometimes don’t grow back at all! So be careful and work with what you have without removing what you may need in the future. You can always brush your brows up and trim any hairs that are out of place or do not fit into your natural brow shape rather than pluck as well. Creating the perfect brow takes trial and error.  The more you play, the more you will figure out what products and brow shape works best for you! Following this eyebrow shape guide will help you get started.\n<br><br>\nYou got this, happy brow shaping!",
