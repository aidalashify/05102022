        "description": "As the beauty industry continues to flourish and grow, the options for false eyelashes have become endless. <br><br>Lashify’s patented, at home, DIY system is revolutionary to the lash and beauty markets. The system enables the eyelashes, called Gossamers, to be placed on the underside of the upper lash. Gossamers are virtually weightless, made of 100% Korean PBT silk. The system calls for the Gossamer to be placed 1mm-2mm away from the root of the natural lash line to allow for growth of the natural lash, prevent damage, and provide comfort. The Lashify Gossamer can be worn for a day, a night, or up to 5 or 7 days with the traditional Whisper Light bond. You can also achieve up to 10 days of wear with Bondage, Lashify’s extra strength bond that is waterproof and steam\/heat resistant. No weight or tension is placed on the natural lash due to the underlash technology not pressing weight on the eyelid or the top of the lashes. Lashify’s bonds are flexible and never fully harden or cure. Lashify’s lashes are made of 100% Korean PBT Silk and are virtually weightless. No harsh lines, no strips on the top of the lid. Nothing but flawless, beautiful, soft lashes.",
