Start experimenting with volume when wearing a simple lash map, and go from there. You can always add more length to the ends, or just keep the volume towards the center if you prefer. Avoid wearing too much volume on the inner corners of the eye, as it will be too heavy and uncomfortable to wear. And lastly, always be mindful of what your natural lashes can handle. Going too heavy, too long, or too curly, even if it’s initially a desired look idea, can bring on issues like being uncomfortable, or un complementary to your overall look.
