        "description": "Most eye shape infographics keep things pretty simple, and group things together when describing an eye shape.  So you may find that your eye shape fits into more than one.  Why?  Because there are different degrees of an eye shape, or a combination of factors involved.  To better understand this, when people say “shape” that technically refers to round, almond, or cat eyed.  However when we say monolid, hooded, or deep set, this actually refers to the lid type not necessarily a “shape”.  <br><br>Yet these descriptions are usually listed as an eye shape category.  That is why you may find yourself having a combination of the descriptions listed.  For example someone can have a large almond eye that is also hooded.  This doesn’t mean you have 2 eyes shapes, but instead it refers to your eye size, shape and lid type.  Someone else can have an upturned monolid, which refers to lid type and positioning.  You get the idea…. \n<br><br>\nTo keep things simple we will also combine eye shape (almond, round), size (small, medium, large), lid type (hooded, monolid, deep set, etc), and positioning (upturned, downturned, wide set, etc) to create 6 basic eye “shape” categories.  Click on the eye shape category below to get more details about that particular category, various combinations and suggested lash maps.\n<br><br>\n1. Round<br>\n2. Almond<br>\n3. Hooded<br>\n4. Upturned<br>\n5. Downturned<br>\n6. Monolid   <br>",

Just like clothes and different body types.  And just like clothes, the lashes you choose will also depend on your personal taste, style, and comfort zone.  So just because you have a certain eye shape doesn’t mean you have to stick to just one style, shape or size.  Therefore, it's important to remember that choosing a style is not just solely based on your eye shape.   In this series you will find great recommendations and tips for each eye shape that you can incorporate into many styles.  This will allow you to create different lash maps for different occasions while following the recommendations for your eye shape.  <br><br>Another factor to consider, is whether you want to accentuate your eye shape, or adjust it a bit due to your personal preference.  For example…. You might have a round eye shape which you love.  Therefore you want to accentuate the shape and stick to the “doe eye look”.  While someone else may feel that because they have naturally rounded eye, they prefer to elongate them.  So the lash placement and styles they choose may be different, even if they have the same eye shape.",

        "description": "1. Avoid placing lashes all the way to the first natural lash in your inner corner.  Most of us have very short fine hair in our inner corners.  They also tend to be straighter due to the moisture in that area.  In addition the spacing between your inner corner lash line, and your lid can be limited.  So for most people, it's not very comfortable to place a lash all the way to that last little baby hair.  It’s totally okay to leave a couple of those out.  You can curl them if they are very straight (our Lashicurl heated silicone lash curler works best), even add a little mascara when wearing the bolder styles.  For the most part it looks very natural, and not noticeable. <br><br>2. We recommend using core styles in the inner corner, even when using the volume styles.  The volume Gossamer styles tend to have more curl and more fibers.  Therefore, they might be too much for your inner corners.  If you feel they are, a good solution is to start with a core lash in the corner, and overlap a volume lash over it.  This is also a great tip for longevity! <br><br> 3. Avoid placing Gossamer lashes all the way to the last natural lash on your outer corner. On most eye shapes, placing a Gossamer all the way to the last natural lash can cause the eye to droop.  We recommend bringing the last lash in a bit.  You can also choose a smaller lash for the outer corner, and overlap a longer lash.",
