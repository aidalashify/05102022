        "description": "First of all, no shade to mascara. As a makeup-bag MVP, this cosmetic does a lot of heavy lifting when it comes to defining your features. And for veritable decades, it was the only game in town. There is also a spectrum when it comes to formulas and brushes—some are far better than others, of course.\n<br><br>\nBut when it comes to comparing mascara with Lashify? It’s just not a fair fight, friends. There’s no comparison. If you want lush, full, gorgeous lashes, it’s all about Lashify. Mascara can’t hold a candle. \n<br><br>\nThink about it like this: If you were shopping for a car, why would you opt for one without power windows? Lashify is the same sort of thing in that it’s an evolved technology from a look, product and experience perspective. So why live in the past? We use the tools we have and the tools have come a long way when it comes to lashes.\n<br><br>\nIf you're new to the Lashify System and not sure where to begin, take a look at our Control Kit; it has absolutely everything you need to get started!\n<br><br>\n<strong>The Lashify Control Kit<\/strong>",

If you want a super lengthy lash look, it takes a couple of coats to pull that off.

Otherwise you can get makeup all over your sheets, not to mention the fact that it’s not good for your eyes to sleep in makeup. Removing waterproof mascara is practically its own special project. Wearing mascara overnight can even contribute to the appearance of fine lines around the eyes. No thanks to that. \n\n<br><br>\nWith Lashify’s removal products, you’ll get a smooth, easy removal of your Gossamers and bond. These products are specially formulated to be gentle and nourishing to your natural lashes and skin—no tugging necessary. With Lashify, you can also wear your Gossamers for up to ten days straight, so there’s no need to take them off before bed every night. Every day you’ll wake up with lashes that are ready to go. \n<br><br>\n<strong>Lashify Melt Away<\/strong>",
