Tejada drew attention to her eyes by placing B12 Gossamers along the center of the lash line and then stacked longer B14 Gossamers on the corners to accentuate the line of the winged eye.",

We couldn't agree more.<br><br>Smalls used A Gossamers at the inner corners of Yola's eyes, then applied two B14 Gossamers as she moved outward. At the center she used two D16 Gossamers stacked on top of each other for an eye-opening effect. Smalls finished off the rest of Yola's eyes with a stacked combo of D14 and F16 Gossamers to complete a look she described as 'uber-divine'.",

Celebrity makeup artist Colby Smith created a peach tonal makeup look that really emphasized her lashes.<br><br>\"The cheek melted into the eye,\" he says. \"The point of it was to showcase the lash. I didn't want to do a heavy eye. I just wanted it to be lash-oriented, and what's great about Lashify is that it goes underneath the lash, so you don't see the band. It let me do a really nude, fresh eye that didn't look like she had any liner on.\" <br><br>Smith applied A10 Gossamers from the outer corners of Lo's eyes to her pupils. For an even more natural approach, Smith didn't apply lashes to Lo's inner corners to keep the eye super open.",
