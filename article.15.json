        "description": "When it comes to eye shapes and lashes the possibilities are endless.  Every single eye shape has its beauty.  You can choose to enhance your shape, or you may be in the mood to alter it.  Sounds like fun right!  Sure, when you know what your eye shape is!!  How can you determine exactly what your eye shape is?  Not to worry, we got you covered.  Check out our first blog post in this series: The Best Eyelashes for Any Eye Shape.  There you will find 5 steps to determine your eye shape.  In this article we will cover the beauty of the Round Eye!  <br><br> Round eyes are often described as “doe eyed” or “doll eyes”.  Round eyes can be small or large.  They will have a visible crease, and you will be able to see the whites of your eyes around the iris. This can be above, below, or both.  There can also be different degrees of a round eye and combined with other features. <br><br> So many strive to achieve that beautiful “doe eyed” look, that many celebrities have.  Such as Audrey Hepburn, Katty Perry, Mila Kunis and more.  Yet so many that have round eyes, say they would prefer “smaller” or more almond shaped eyes!  The good news is that with round eyes, you can either enhance your eye shape, or with lashes and makeup create an illusion of a more almond, small, or even cat eyed look.  And the Lashify DIY Extension System makes it so easy to customize and create anything you want!  So let’s get started.",
