        "description": "A wide set eye leaves a lot of space in the center of the face, creating a long vertical facial appearance. The issue presented here is, you can’t really use long inner corner lashes, it would definitely not be complementary to any eye shape! This eye placement is going to use a curly lash in a medium length all the way across the eye to bring shadow not only to the inner part of the eye, but to the entire eyelid. An example of this would be 12mm, extra curly straight across. You can add a small amount of 8mm on the inner corner if the medium length is too much or uncomfortable, but you would use half the amount of short lash typically used on most lash maps. A rounded lash map with a strong jump to a long center Can also look great. You would use a small, medium\/large, and large lash size, followed by medium\/large and small. The majority of this look will be long center lashes that extended into your inner and outer corners more than a typical rounded lash map would. This will create the inner corner shadows that help bring the eyes in more, creating a more centered eye spacing.",

One thing that you might want to look out for however. is too much curl on the outer ends of your eye. The reason being is that when you already have an eye shape that goes up, you may not want to further bring that shape higher by using the illusion wearing a tight curl brings to lift. \n<br><br>\nAchieving a winged eye style with your type of eye shape requires less curl, and more length on the outer corners of your eyes. You can pair that with a curlier center and\/or inner portion of the eye to increase the lift in these areas, or you can go all the way across with a lash style that Has less to moderate curl. You are free to choose lengths that you feel compliment your eyes as you wish.",

The combination helps to create a more proportionate facial structure by taking away from the bridge of the nose and adding to the outer sides of your face.\n\n<br><br>\nIf you prefer a more rounded lash look, you will again want to focus on extra short inner corner lashes, gradually going up in size with the longest placed in the center.
